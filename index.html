                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I aim to build a career grounded in curiosity, problem-solving, and integrity, using technology to
make a meaningful impact. I’m passionate about coding, system design, and cybersecurity, and
I enjoy the challenge of finding solutions that are both practical and creative. I want to be seen
as dependable, driven, and adaptable, someone who not only meets challenges but also
elevates the people around me. Professionally, my goal is to contribute in fields like software
engineering or cybersecurity while continuing to grow and refine my skills. Socially, I want to be
known as collaborative and trustworthy, making each team I’m part of stronger. At the end of my
career, I hope to be remembered for meaningful contributions, continuous growth, and a
balance of ambition with kindness.</p>
